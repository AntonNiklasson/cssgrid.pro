  **You just created a grid!**

  The items are stacking vertically because we haven't defined any columns yet. By default, a grid has just one column.

  Next, we'll define the structure with columns and rows.

# What is CSS Grid?

CSS Grid is a **two-dimensional layout system** for the web. It lets you control both columns AND rows at the same time.

## Grid vs Flexbox

You might already know Flexbox. Here's when to use each:

| Flexbox | Grid |
|---------|------|
| **One dimension** (row OR column) | **Two dimensions** (rows AND columns) |
| Navigation bars, button groups | Page layouts, card grids |
| Content-driven sizing | Structure-driven sizing |

**They work great together!** Use Grid for the overall page layout, Flexbox for components inside.

## Let's start

To create a grid, set `display: grid` on a container element. This tells the browser: "this element is now a grid, and its children are grid items."

**Your turn:** Type `grid` below to create your first grid.

export const markup = `<div class="grid">
  <div class="item">1</div>
  <div class="item">2</div>
  <div class="item">3</div>
</div>`;

export const styles = {
  '.grid': {
    properties: {
      'display': {
        value: '',
        input: {
          placeholder: 'grid',
          regex: /^grid;?$/,
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
