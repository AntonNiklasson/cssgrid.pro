# Rows & Columns

You can define the columns in the grid by setting any number of "lengths" as you want in the `grid-template-columns` property.

```
grid-template-columns: 100px 200px 100px;
```

The same goes for `grid-template-rows`:

```
grid-template-rows: 100px 200px 100px;
```

These values are any valid CSS "length" value. Basically anything that describes a distance in some unit. A deeper explanation is available on MDN: [CSS Length](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length)
