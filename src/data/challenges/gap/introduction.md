# Gap

Adding some space between your cells in the grid is a piece of cake. \`grid-gap\` takes any
kind of "length" argument.

```
grid-gap: 10px;
```

This will space cells out with 10px between them both vertically and horizontally. It also works with two parameters:

```
grid-gap: 100px 30px;
```

This reads as "100px between rows, and 10px between columns".

`grid-gap` is a shorthand property for `grid-column-gap` and `grid-row-gap`.
