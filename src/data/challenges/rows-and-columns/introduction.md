# Rows & Columns

You can define the columns in the grid by setting any number of "lengths" as you want in the `grid-template-columns` property.

```
grid-template-columns: 100px 200px;
```

The same goes for `grid-template-rows`:

```
grid-template-rows: 300px 300px;
```

Try to make a grid with two columns and two rows.
